I am the oldest of 5 and I was born and raised in California! I am a senior studying Computer Engineering. Outside my academics, I am the Vice President of External Affairs for the chapter of Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers here at BU, which I have been a part of since my freshman year. I have been heavily involved with Alianza Latina since my freshman year and during my sophomore year I decided to take a leadership position by being part of the Hermanos Program, which I am still part of today. I have a passion for giving back to my community, coffee, running and puppies!
